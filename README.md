# Unity Project Webgl Template
This is a Unity Webgl template created using HTML and CSS.

It is a modified template initially from Unity. So to implement it follow the Implementation Steps.

Here is one of my games using this template: https://cuboost-website.web.app/cuboost-game.html.

## Implementation Steps
1. Update the page title
2. Add Text about your game in the about-game-text div.
3. Update the path for the fullscreen button.
4. Update the name of your Unity game in the unity-footer.
5. Update the buildUrl, loaderUrl, and config in the Unity script located in the HTML file.
6. Delete the Unity generated CSS file located under the TemplateData folder.
